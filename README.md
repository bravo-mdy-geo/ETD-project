## Abstract
- Electronic Thesis and Dissertation System is a work submitted in support of candidature for a doctorate or master’s degree.
- Electronic version of theses and dissertations are called ETDs. This system is kind of Education website.
- In our system , users can search theses and dissertations of CU (Mdy) by Year, and can see abstract of the thesis,
author name, supervisor name and the major. Users can also search books and theses of Otago University and Global ETD for more references.
- For admin Panel, admins can insert data into database,delete and retrieve data for database. Users can use our system with both smart phones and computers. 
- For Front End, the system was implemented using material design (HTML, CSS).
- For Back End, this system was implemented  using javascript and jQuery. And we also used Firebase Hosting and Database.

## DECLARATION

We declare that this project report or part of was not a copy of a document done by any organization,
university any other institute or a previous student project group at Computer University (Mandalay) and
was not copied from the Internet or other sources.


#### Project Details
Project Title   	**_Electronic Thesis and Dissertation System_** <br/>
Project ID  	        **_Geo Mandalar Invertment & Technology Co.,Ltd Internship_**

1.1 **Introduction**

- Nowadays, modern technologies are sharply developed. And most of the people widely use internet with mobile phones and computers for various purposes.
 Most of the universities around the world use online libraries.
 In that libraries, students can search books at every time and everywhere.
 It can save time and energy.

- Our project ETD (Electronic thesis and dissertation), it mainly focuses to search easily theses and dissertations of Computer University (Mandalay) at one place. In our project, students can search theses with their abstracts from 2008 to 2016. 
	
- In our ETD project, students can also search theses reference books and global theses and dissertations from other universities around the world for various fields and major.

- The aims of our ETD project is to save time and energy, to reduce paper works and familiar with electronic library.

1.2	**Background of the System** <br/><br/>
 1.2.1**What is firebase?** <br />
- Firebase is a platform that makes developing android apps or web app easier.
- It is owned by Google and is easy to Integrate to projects
- It combines Database, Authentication, Storage, Hosting, Functions.
- Database – store data as a tree
- Authentication - Use firebase as a database to manage users
- Hosting – Offer lightweight configuration options for building web apps. We can easily rewrite URLs for client-side routing or set up custom headers.
- Storage - Store data by using firebase as backend such as images
- Functions- Automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests.<br />
Among them ,We use firebase hosting and firebase database in our project.<br /><br />

1.2.2 **What is a firebase hosting?** <br />
	The production-grade web content hosted for developers is called as firebase hosting. With the help of hosting, user can quickly and easily deploy web apps or content to the CDN (Global content delivery network) using a single command. Firebase hosting gives user a fast, secure, and reliable way to host the app’s static assets such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and media files. It is very easy process in Firebase because it contains Custom domain support, and Global CDN. Whether users are sending a simple application landing page or a complex Progress Web App. Hosting gives user the infrastructure, features, and manage static website.

<br/>1.2.3 **What is a firebase database?**<br />
	A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Data gets updated, expanded and deleted as new information is added. 
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is syned across all clients in realtime, and remains available when the app goes offline.
 Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When user build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, 
and JavaScript SDKs, all of the clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data. By utilizing 
this feature of Firebase, there is no necessity to make the own database. Firebase handles all the components that usually come along with creating
 a backend for applications. It gives an adaptable, expression-based rules language to define how the data should be organized and when information can be 
perusd from or composed to. When user point the app to the proper data source in Firebase, it will retrieve the data in real-time.

## Objectives of the project 
- To save time for taking  thesis guideline and thesis information
-  To help students be better prepared as knowledge workers
- To develop university digital library services and infrastructure
 - To increase sharing and collaboration among university and students
 - To enhance access to university research

1.4	**Scope of Proposed System** <br/>
The proposed project of Electronic Thesis and Dissertation is prescribed as follow;
- Manage Home, ThesisResource, Publisher, Admin, Search, Learn More
- View Home
- View ThesisResource
- View Publisher
- View Admin
- View Learn More 


2.1 **Software Selection** <br /><br />
 &nbsp;  **Choose Programming Language** <br />
	We would like to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, material design lite in our project because there are a lot of benefits to pick up languages in our windows form application. 
-	HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup.
-	CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
-	Javascript is a high-level and interpreted programming language.
-	JQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
-	Material Design Lite makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.
-	They are readily available and easy to access.

**Software Requirements**
-	Firebase (Database and  Hosting)
-	Submit Text 3
-	Git bash
-	Github<br />
**Hardware Requirements**
-	Internet Access
-	 PC with Windows OS
-	Mobile Phone


## Conclusion
- This system provides users to search easily CU (Mdy) theses from 2008-2016 with abstract. 
- At admin panel, admin can create, retrieve, update and delete data from firebase database. And also do permissions for login users.
- Our project has a weakness. It doesn’t show full data of all thesis because our data are collected from CU (Mdy) library and there is no soft copy of theses.
- But we make our ETD system to find global theses and dissertations for more reference. Users can search 5,111,718 electronic theses and dissertations at Global ETD site where can find any fields that you want.
- For our project future plan, we aim to do more useful site for our university. We want to make from ETD mini project to CU (Mdy) e-Library.

**Advantages of the Project** <br />
The proposed system offers the following advantages:
-	It provides “faster and better” services to users.
-	This is helpful in assessing what’s in progress, what has written, the writing style, how it was structured, research methods, and which reference were used.
-	User can satisfy because they can search not only thesis title but also by year.
-	Assisting postgraduate students to write theses and dissertations.
-	Provide facility for proper monitoring, reduces paper work and provide data security.

**Disadvantages** <br />
-	The cost of computer hardware and software programs can be expensive.
-	As mobile tablets use wireless network, they can disconnect with network if Wi Fi fails.
